# Alexa_Reviews_Sentiment_Analysis
This GitHub project, created using a Jupyter Notebook, is all about understanding how people feel about Amazon Alexa based on their reviews. It's like teaching the computer to read reviews and figure out if they are positive, negative, or neutral. The project includes steps to get the data ready, pull out important information, and use simple computer techniques to guess if a review is happy or not. It's a great starting point for beginners to learn about analyzing feelings in text and can be a fun way to explore how computers understand human language.
